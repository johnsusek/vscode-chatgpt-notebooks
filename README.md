# ChatGPT Notebooks for VSCode

Welcome to the unofficial ChatGPT Notebooks extension!

Use "Code" cells to enter your prompts. The execute cell function will send the conversation up to that point to the OpenAI API.

You can choose your model in settings (default GPT-4).

"Markdown" cells cannot be executed and are not sent to the API.

## Code Cell vs Markdown Cell

VSCode notebooks have two types of cells: Code and Markdown.

Code cells can be executed (i.e. sent to the API), Markdown cells cannot.

*Within a Code cell, any type of language can be selected for syntax highlighting. One of them is Markdown, which this extension uses, so that you can mix text and syntax highlighted code in your prompts.*
